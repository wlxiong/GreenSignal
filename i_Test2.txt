% Test input file of Green Signal
% Draft Version
% Feb 28, 2008
% 
% Format of the input file: 
% 1. The input file has ordinary ".txt" file name extension and its file name begins with "i_", e.g. the file you are reading is named "i_Test.txt".
% 2. "%" is the comment symbol in this input file. The program should ignore any line beginning with a percentage symbol.
% 3. Any expression begins with a keyword, e.g. setting, time, initoccp.
% 4. Every section (see below) begins with a expression only containing a keyword (e.g. setting) and ends with keyword "end".
% 5. The sequence of expressions within section is insensitive, i.e. changes of sequence of expressions in a section make no difference.
% 
% Sections of the input file: 
% 1. Setting parameters. In this part, the general simulation information is included.
% 2. Geometry structure. The scale and topology of the traffic network are presented here.
% 3. Control scheme. The scheme consist of the location of intersection, approaching arcs, maximum (minimum) green time, phase, etc.
% 4. Traffic flow. Traffic demand, diverging and merging are presented here.
% 5. Event information. This section describes any event that changes the capacity and jam density of particular arc.

setting
% Section I - Setting parameters.
time 08:00:00 08:05:00
% The beginning and end time of the simulation run
clock 1
% The discrete time interval between clock ticks. The unit of time is second.
epsilon 0.01
% Any quantities smaller than epsilon will be ignored.
initoccp 0
% The initial cell occupation percentage.
initctrl 0
% The initial control strategy: 
% 0 - every phase length is assigned the minimum green time and the cycle length is minimum green time multiplied by number of phase.
% 1 - both phase length and cycle length are fixed according to Webster's formula.

traffic
% Section IV - Traffic flow

% Traffic demands as follow:
%                (1)         (2)       (3)
%               start      origin    traffic

demand        08:00:00        1        3.0
% Traffic demand at origin node (2) equals (3) from time (1) on.
%
% Traffic diverges as follow:
%             (1)      (2)       (3)       (4)
%             from     to       diverge

diverge        1        3        0.7        0
% Percentage (3) of traffic flow enters arc (2) from arc (1).
% There are three types of diverge:
% 1. Type 0 indicates traffic flow goes through straight.
% 2. Type 1 indicates traffic flow turns right.
% 3. Type 2 indicates traffic flow turns left.
% 
% Traffic merges as follow:
%           (1)      (2)
%           from     to
%           arc      arc

% There are 9 columns above: 
% 1. Column (1) numbers intersection.
% 2. Column (2) specifies the type of intersection:
%    a) Type 0 indicates nonsignalized intersection.
%    b) Type 1 indicates signalized intersection.
% 2. Columns (3)(4) are the coordinates of intersection.
% 3. Columns (5)(6) are the minimum and maximum green time respectively.
% 4. Columns (7) is 1 if right turning traffic flow is allowed in any phase, otherwise 0.
% 5. Columns (8) is the number of phase at the intersection.
% 6. Column (9) contains all the nodes connected at the intersection.
% 7. A nonsignalized intersection do not have columns (5)(6)(7)(8) and the phases as follow.
% 
% The followings are the phases of the intersection:
